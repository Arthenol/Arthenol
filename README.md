- 👋 Hi, I’m @Arthenol
- 👀 I’m interested in becoming a developer and to fulfill my long life dream of a stable life. That's the goal, whatever it takes.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning and focusing on "Java-script, HTML+CSS". (more languages will be added).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything i can help out with. IF i have a piece of a puzzle, then you have a solution.
